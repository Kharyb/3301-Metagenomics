A Tale of Two Parks: Biogeographic patterns of microbial diversity in urban park soils, the Gordon Square data.

Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S V4 region we assess the bacterial and archaeal communities of Gordon Square in London, and compare them with those of Central Park in New York City described by a previous study: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1795/20141988

Despite the lower number of distinct phylotypes in Gordon Square, both parks were found to contain similarly structured communities.

Highly predictable microbial diversity patterns based on physicochemical soil properties were found in Central Park, but not in Gordon Square, which was correlated with a lower variability of Acidobacteria abundance across samples.
